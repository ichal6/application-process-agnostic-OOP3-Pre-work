# SQL---application-process
## Console application

1. ~~Create a Console Application with some simple menu, where each menu point answers one question (or does what the question asks) from the queries section above.~~

2. Add advanced search feature to your application. Advanced search should take a search phrase from user and later on look for it in all tables in the database.

3. ~~Add records adding and updating feature. User should provide required data and those data should be saved in the database.~~

## Additional requirements
* ~~Save your queries to queries.sql file.~~
* ~~Implement that application using MVC and DAO patterns.~~
* ~~If the question is to print out some table, please print it out in some readable way (e.g. different rows on separate lines, no unnecessary parenthesis around values etc.), but don't mess a lot with formatting.~~
